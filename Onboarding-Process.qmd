## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Science Department at the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (MRCG\@LSHTM)!

This document serves as a guide to assist new team members during the on-boarding process. Our goal is to ensure a smooth transition into your new role and provide clarity on your responsibilities during the initial phase of employment or internship.

The department comprises both international and local staffs, along with internship opportunities lasting for a maximum of 6 months. Each staff category undergoes a distinct on-boarding process, albeit with some overlapping elements. Consequently, this document is structured according to staff categories.

## Interns

-   Health and Safety induction

    During this induction, you are oriented on the health and safety guidelines such as accident and hazard reporting, board-sign meanings, the various emergency numbers, trash bin color indications, the fire assembly points, etc. More importantly, you will be introduced to best posture for your body while working with computers and how often you need to take a break to prevent muscle, eye pains and issues.

    It lasts for about an hour. At the end of the session, you will be asked ten questions to test your understanding of the topics been introduced to you. A minimum of five (5) right answers is required (50 %) or otherwise you will be asked to return for the same induction the following week until passed.

-   Security Office

    The security office is located next to the main gate. This is where you will be provided with the MRCG\@LSHTM student ID card with the following details: name, department, expiration date and card number for identification purposes. You will also be given an access card to get you in the department building (MLB building). You will be re-enlightened about the security practices to follow for your safety and that of everyone in the unit.

-   IT Department

    This is a crucial step of the on-boarding process. New interns will go through an induction where they are presented with an electronic article about the director of the unit, services provided by the HR department, and clinical services at the Gate Clinic and the IT department, respectively. After completion of the different sections, the intern will be subjected to a test. You are needed to pass it with a score of at least 80% or redo the whole process.

    When it is successfully completed, a user account is created for you with a default password. You can update this password immediately after.

-   Communications Department

    During the communications induction, you are introduced to the various ways of communication within the unit, the seminars, the weekly newsletters, and a list of to do and not do things. It can last for about an hour.
