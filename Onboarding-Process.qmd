## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Science Department at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit The Gambia! This document serves as a guide to assist new team members during the onboarding process. Our goal is to ensure a smooth transition into your new role and provide clarity on your responsibilities during the initial phase of employment.

The department comprises both international and local staff, along with internship opportunities lasting a maximum of 6 months. Each staff category undergoes a distinct onboarding process, albeit with some overlapping elements. Consequently, this document is structured according to staff categories.

## Internships

-   Health and Safety Office visit

    It is the first visit made. You are oriented on health and safety-related issues such as accident and hazard reporting, board-sign meanings, the various emergency numbers, trash bin colour indications and so on. It lasts for about an hour. At the end of the session, you are given a ten-question test in which you are required to have at least five questions right (50 %) or otherwise return for the same sitting the following week until passed.

-   Security Office visit

    On my next visit, I visited the security office. I was provided with the MRC Unit student ID card carrying details such as my name, department, expiration date and card number for identification purposes. I was also given the access card to be able to have access to the department building. I was re-enlightened about the security practices I needed to follow for my safety and that of everyone in the unit.

-   IT Lab visit

    I visited the the IT lap at the IT department. A user account was created for me comprising of a default username and password, in which I needed to change the password to one that is confidential and meets the minimum requirements. I was also presented with an electronic article about the director of the unit, services provided by the HR department, and clinical services of the Gate Clinic and the IT department, respectively. Under each of those sections and upon completion of reading, you are required to do a test. You are needed to pass it with a score of at least 80% or redo the whole process.

-   Communications Department visit

    Under the communications department, we were oriented on the various ways communication is done among employees within the unit. Seminars and weekly newsletters were also treated. It lasts for about an hour.
